A payday loan, also called a small amount loan, lets you borrow up to $2,000. You have between 16 days and one year to pay it back.

While it might look like a quick fix, a payday loan has a lot of fees. For example, to pay back a $2,000 payday loan over one year, your total repayments will be about $3,360. That's $1,360 more than you borrowed.

There are cheaper ways to borrow money when you need it.

If you're getting a payday loan to pay off another loan, talk to a financial counsellor. It's free and confidential.
